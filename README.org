I wanted a very simple and free API to get the current time. That's
all. For some reason, I had a hard time finding one that didn't
require registration or anything like that. I created a very simple
AWS Lambda function to return the current UTC time with a few very
common formats.

To see this in production visit https://utc.guru

The idea is that this could be an easy domain to test your REST client
and API code when setting up an initial project.

This is an example ~curl~ request that give you a sense of what this is:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ curl -s 'https://utc.guru' | jq
